I am currently rebuilding Community Voices web application with Symfony web framework (PHP), following N-tier architecture, object-oriented design, Model-View-Controller and two-step view. Community Voices is a component of <a href="https://environmentaldashboard.org">Environmental Dashboard</a>. It combines images, thoughts, ideas and actions of community members and groups to celebrate and empower positive action. The application includes a multimedia display system, a login system, a content management system and a standalone API layer. 

I joined this project in January, 2018.
