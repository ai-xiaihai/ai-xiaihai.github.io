I built my website with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which makes uses of <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>.
The website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.
The front-end design of this website is based on a Jekyll theme <a href="https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/">Moon</a>.
